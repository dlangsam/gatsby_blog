description: I'm attempting a blog for the first time in 15+ years
---

Wow I feel like I haven't had a blog since my Xanga in 2014. I wonder if I dig hard enough I can find that. Ah the wonders of the internet. I'm sure I wasn't as clever as I thought I was which is probably some of my hesitation with starting a website now. But I'd like to finally have a place to showcase some of the projects I'm working on whether it's code, new recipes, or a fun pinterest fail. I've been using Gatsby at work and am really enjoying it so I figured my own blog using Gatsby would be a good place to start. So here goes nothing. I hope I don't sound like an angsty teen anymore...

A little about me.
I'm a software engineer in Miami, FL. I originally studied mathematics at Washington University in St. Louis and then went on to get my masters in C.S. I love to cook and my boyfriend and I have a bit of an appliance addiction. He's been working his way through [Jeni's ice cream cook book](https://jenis.com/cookbooks/) I've been trying to master fresh pasta. I also enjoy other crafts such as sewing, making homemade cards, and using sculpey to make jewelry occasionally.
